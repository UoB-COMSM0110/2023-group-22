# Introduction

Our primary goal during the planning phase of our video game brief was to capture a modern, recognizable brand that was flexible and approachable to every kind of user while adhering to specific constraints derived from user stories. As a result, early discussions shifted away from more traditional forms of arcade gaming such as Pac-Man or Space Invaders.Instead, group ideas that were shortlisted sought to capture the instantly identifiable nostalgia of games that we, as video game players ourselves, grew up with, and which also met the requirements outlined in the ideation process.

Our game finally coalesced into a platforming video game, providing a twist on the original iPhone game Doodle Jump. The platforming aspect of Doodle Jump provided the perfect combination of simple, easy-to-pick-up game mechanics as well as the ability to implement a diverse range of gameplay twists. In our game you control your ‘doodle’, a customizable player character whose main objective is to steadily climb higher through a randomly generated environment. While doing so, players will encounter several obstacles whose goal is to slow down or defeat the player. These obstacles include different types of platforms such as ghost ledges, which cause the player to fall straight through, or single-use platforms that disappear when stepped on. Obstacles also include active enemies who spawn at varying intervals throughout the map, attempting to end the current user’s game. At the player’s disposal are several powerful abilities or ‘equipment’ that encourage fast-moving platforming, such as spring mechanisms and jetpack boosts. What distinguishes our game from other implementations of platforming games and Doodle Jump itself is the introduction of core game-play twists. These include:

1.	dynamic map manipulation by players that allows for exciting in-game problem solving

2.	gravity inversion that shifts gameplay away from traditional platforming and towards a race-against-the-clock style

3.	a competitive two-player version that pits users against each other in an ‘elimination-style’ twist on the Doodle Jump formula

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the development of our Doodle Jump-inspired game presented numerous challenges and learning opportunities. Our project encompassed the creation of a comprehensive system architecture, incorporating various components such as the Game Manager, User Interface, and Game Elements. These components worked together to provide an engaging and seamless gaming experience.

Throughout the development process, we focused on building a well-structured codebase. The use of system architecture, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams played a crucial role in achieving this goal. They offered clear organization and nurtured communication among team members, ensuring everyone shared a common understanding of the code's structure and interactions. This approach facilitated better planning, design, easier debugging, and improved scalability and maintainability.

Adopting an Agile development approach enabled us to iteratively refine our game mechanics, user interface, and overall user experience. The Agile methodology allowed us to be flexible and responsive to feedback gathered from users, leading to continuous improvement throughout the project. We conducted evaluations and gathered user feedback, which played a critical role in guiding our development decisions and ensuring the game met the desired quality standards. This iterative evaluation process allowed us to identify and address potential issues early on, contributing to a more polished and enjoyable gaming experience.

We encountered various challenges during development, including refining the gameplay experience and ensuring a smooth integration of multiple gameplay twists. To address these challenges, we developed creative solutions, such as adjusting equipment interactions for fairness in the two-player mode and creating a layered user interface that allowed for easy customization of game settings.

This project provided valuable lessons in teamwork, project management, and game development. We learned the importance of clear communication and organization, as well as the value of incorporating user feedback into our design process. Our experience adopting Agile development practices also highlighted the advantages of iterative development and continuous improvement.

Despite our progress, there is potential for further improvements and expansion. The game could benefit from enhanced visual and audio design, providing a more immersive experience for players. We could also explore the implementation of additional gameplay twists, mechanics, and challenges to keep the game fresh and engaging. Further user testing and feedback will be invaluable in refining the game and ensuring its appeal to players of all skill levels. Additionally, we could explore integrating online multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against each other from different locations.

Overall, our Doodle Jump-inspired game project was a rewarding experience that taught us valuable skills and insights into software engineering, particularly in the context of game development. The challenges we faced and the lessons learned in the process have broadened our understanding of effective software design, project management, and teamwork. By reflecting on these experiences, we are better equipped to tackle future projects and create software solutions that are efficient, scalable, and maintainable.

Applying the principles of software engineering to game development has demonstrated the importance of planning, organization, and communication in achieving a successful project outcome. As we continue to grow as software engineers, we will carry forward the lessons learned from this project, incorporating user feedback, adopting Agile development practices, and focusing on creating well-structured codebases. These experiences will enable us to deliver high-quality software products that not only meet the needs of users but also stand the test of time.
